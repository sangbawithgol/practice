    <li><h2>Joseon</h2></li>
    The first 200 years of Joseon were marked by relative peace.
    During this period, the Korean alphabet was created by Sejong the Great in the 15th century and there was increasing influence of Confucianism.
    During the later part of the dynasty, Korea's isolationist policy earned it the Western nickname of the "Hermit Kingdom".
    By the late 19th century, the country became the object of imperial design by the Empire of Japan.
    After the First Sino-Japanese War, despite the Korean Empire's effort to modernize,
    it was annexed by Japan in 1910 and ruled by Imperial Japan until the end of World War II in August 1945.
