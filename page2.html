    Korea emerged as a singular political entity in 676 AD, after centuries of conflict among the Three Kingdoms of Korea,
    which were unified as Unified Silla to the south and Balhae to the north.
    Unified Silla divided into three separate states during the Later Three Kingdoms period. Goryeo, which had succeeded Goguryeo,
    defeated the two other states and united the Korean Peninsula. Around the same time, Balhae collapsed and its last crown prince fled south to Goryeo.
    Goryeo (also spelled as Koryŏ), whose name developed into the modern exonym "Korea"
    , was a highly cultured state that created the world's first metal movable type in 1234.[5][6][7][8][9][10]
